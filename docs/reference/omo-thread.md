# omo thread - the session gateway from scripts and connectors

`omo thread` runs every thread operation the agent tools offer (`thread_list`, `thread_send`,
`thread_read`, `thread_bind` ... `thread_answer`) without an agent session. It is how a script,
a cron job or a chat connector talks to running OmO sessions: terminal sessions (`tui`),
Desktop threads and task children on their hosts (`rpc_host`).

It never starts a host. Sessions are listed from what the engine enumerates
(`host status --all`), and bindings, the outbox and delivery receipts live in the gateway store
(`<agent dir>/gateway/`). Every call runs as the principal `cli:<uid>`: receipts, loop budgets
and bindingless sends are keyed by it, and a delivered message carries the provenance header
`source=external`, `actor=<os user>`.

```bash
omo thread list [--all-scope] [--json]
omo thread send <target> <text> [--mode auto|steer|follow_up] [--expected-turn <n>] [--idempotency-key <k>] [--json]

```

A target or session is a durable session id, or an exact name. Without `--all-scope` only
sessions in the current directory's workspace resolve (the same rule the agent tools apply);
an id outside it is `scope_denied`. `--idempotency-key` on a mutation replays the first result
instead of acting twice (`deduplicated: true`); reusing a key with other arguments is
`idempotency_conflict`.

## Sending

A bindingless `send` delivers as `cli:<uid>`. `--mode auto` (the default) starts a turn on an idle
session and otherwise queues behind the running turn, like `follow_up`; only `steer` enters a
running turn, and it needs `--expected-turn` (the target's turn epoch): a missing epoch is
`invalid_arguments`, a changed one `turn_conflict`. A target with no live endpoint gets
`delivery.kind: "queued_offline"`: the row is durable and the session takes it when it runs again,
exactly once. That holds whether its terminal exited, was killed or is stopped, and when no endpoint
of the agent dir is running at all: for a send, nothing live is the offline case, never
`host_unavailable`. A session no endpoint lists is still found by its durable id (the session file
the engine names after it under `<agent dir>/sessions/`) or by its `/name` (the session files of the
current workspace, or of every workspace with `--all-scope`), so any process can address it, not
only one that saw it running. An unknown target is `not_found`; a name two sessions share is
`ambiguous_target`.
A terminal session is never prompted directly; the message lands in its inbox and its own
extension admits it (a held draft in the editor is never overwritten).

`send --binding <id>` is the connector inbound path: the message is delivered to the binding's
session as `binding:<id>`, and `--idempotency-key` is the platform's event id, so one platform
message is admitted once. A target, when given, must be the binding's session.

- **Mode.** Without `--mode` the message takes the binding's `inbound_mode`. `--mode` sets it per
  message, capped by the binding: `follow_up` is allowed on an `auto` binding, but `--mode auto` on
  a `follow_up` binding is refused `invalid_arguments` (exit 1, `details: {binding_id, mode,
  inbound_mode}`). It is never silently downgraded. So one binding per thread can deliver the
  owner's messages as `auto` and everyone else's as `follow_up`. `--mode steer` and
  `--expected-turn` are usage errors (exit 2): a binding message never steers.
- **Author.** `--author-id <platform-user-id> --author-name <display>` (plus an optional
  `--author-user-id <id>`, the omo user the connector mapped them to) names the human who wrote the
  message, as the connector authenticated them. Author flags are accepted only with `--binding`, and
  `--author-id` and `--author-name` go together; anything else is a usage error (exit 2). Each field
  must be non-empty, at most 256 characters, and a single line: a control character, newline or
  Unicode line separator is `invalid_arguments` (exit 1). The author is stored on the delivery's
  external origin and rendered in the provenance header, outside the body, as JSON-quoted fields:
  `author="Jane Doe" author_id="U123"` (and `author_user_id="..."`). Brackets inside a value are
  escaped as `\u005b`/`\u005d`, so the body or a display name can never add or close a header
  field; a body that says `author=owner` is still just the body. `actor=` stays the binding's
  account, the bot the connector speaks as.
- The SDK takes the same: `send({ binding_id, text, mode, author: { platform_user_id, display, user_id? } })`.
  An `author` without `binding_id` is `invalid_arguments`.

What the receiving session does with a delivery depends on its state when its drain runs:

| State | `auto` | `steer` | `follow_up` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| idle | starts a turn (`started`) | refused `not_steerable` | starts a turn (`started`) |
| mid-turn | queued behind the turn (`queued`) | steered into the turn when `--expected-turn` is the current epoch (`steered`), else `turn_conflict` | queued behind the turn (`queued`) |
| waiting on a question | queued (`queued`) | refused `not_steerable` | queued (`queued`) |
| compacting | queued (`queued`) | refused `not_steerable` | queued (`queued`) |
| offline (no live endpoint) | kept for the next run (`queued_offline`) | refused `turn_conflict` | kept for the next run (`queued_offline`) |

The user always wins over a delivery: while the terminal's editor holds a draft, or a submission
has not reached the session yet, the delivery waits and is admitted on the next wake. The session
shows a one-line notice ("remote message from <actor> queued (<delivery_id>)") once per delivery
that waits. The `send` reply reports what happened by the time it returns, so a message the
session has not admitted yet is `queued` with a `queue_position`.

Every send is checked against fixed budgets, which no setting raises:

| Guard | Limit | Answer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Message size | 1 MiB for `send` (with or without `--binding`); 32 KiB for `report` and `answer` text | `message_too_large` |
| Backlog of one target | 128 undelivered messages or 1 MiB | `queue_full` |
| One sender to one target | bursts of 8, then one every 5 s; a binding sender is keyed by binding and author (`binding:<id>#author:<platform user id>`), or by the binding alone when the message names no author | `overloaded` with `retry_after_ms` |
| One turn | reaches at most 16 sessions | `overloaded` |
| One causal chain (a message and the messages it caused) | 4 hops, 64 deliveries, 7 days | `loop_detected` |
| Replies | a direct reply to the session that messaged this one, or a send to itself | `loop_detected` |
| An undelivered message | expires after 24 hours (or when its binding expires) | the row ends `refused` |

Answers to another session flow back through `read`, `report` and `answer`, not through a reply.

A connector treats `overloaded` as back-pressure, not as a lost message: nothing was written, so
it queues the message and retries the same `send` (same `--idempotency-key`) after
`error.details.retry_after_ms`. It passes `--author-*` on every message it can attribute, so one
busy human in a thread spends only their own budget; without an author every human in the thread
shares the binding's one bucket.

## Store extensions

JavaScript packages register extensions on the `createThreadSdk(...)` result exported by the
shipped `runtime/thread-sdk/sdk.js`. `createGatewayStore` is an internal source factory, not an
export of a shipped bundle. Registration is local to the SDK's store handle; each process
registers the extensions it uses.

```typescript
const { createThreadSdk } = await import(`${pluginRoot}/runtime/thread-sdk/sdk.js`)
const store = createThreadSdk({ agentDir, cwd: process.cwd(), uid: process.getuid(), user: "connector" })
const registered = await store.registerStoreExtension({
  name: "notes",
  migrations: [["CREATE TABLE notes_items (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, text TEXT)"]],
  moduleUrl: new URL("./dist/store-ops.mjs", import.meta.url).href,
})
const result = await store.extensionCall("notes", "remember", { id: 1, text: "hello" })
await store.dispose()
```

The compiled `.js`, `.mjs` or `.cjs` module exports named operations `(tx, args) => result`
(async is supported). TypeScript is not stripped in the worker. Arguments and results must be
structured-cloneable. Both API methods return `{ kind: "ok", value }` or
`{ kind: "refused", code, message }`; registration's value is `{ version }`.

`name` matches `^[a-z][a-z0-9_]{1,31}$` and must not collide with a core namespace or prefix
any core object name. Names such as `gateway`, `thread`, and `sqlite` are rejected at registration.
Each migration step is an array of SQL statements,
tracked in `extension_schema`, independently of core `user_version`. Registration and calls
ensure pending steps after core migrations. Each step takes `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` and re-reads the
version under the lock, so concurrent processes apply it once. Overlapping namespaces such as
`alpha` and `alpha_beta` are allowed in either registration order, but neither owns the other's
objects. An unowned object already bearing the namespace prefix blocks its first registration.

Operations run in one `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`. The transaction surface is:

- `all(columns, sql, params?, orderBy?)`, `one(columns, sql, params?)`, and `exec(sql, params?)`:
  one SQLite statement per call, using `?` parameters (`string | number | null`). Reads return
  records keyed by the explicit columns; `one` returns `undefined` when absent; `exec` returns
  the changed-row count. Use `orderBy` for ordered reads. Only anonymous parameter tokens are
  replaced; literal question marks in SQL strings, quoted identifiers and comments are preserved.
  `exec` can also create, alter and drop the extension's own objects during an operation, not
  just during migration. Identifiers and schema qualifiers follow SQLite's ASCII case folding.
- `enqueue({ binding_id, event_id, text, author?, mode? })`: the relay's inbound validation,
  including resolution through its shared live-and-disk address book, author-specific rate
  limits, mode ceiling and idempotency. A missing target returns `not_found`, just as relay
  inbound does. It does not wake a live endpoint before commit. Enqueue requires a binding;
  there is no `enqueueToSession` operation. The filesystem wake marker is created before commit;
  the receiver's transaction waits for the writer before reading the queued delivery.
  `deliveries.actor_user_id` records `author.user_id`, or NULL without it.
- `bind({ principal, binding, idempotency_key? })`, `unbind({ principal, binding_id,
  expected_revision, idempotency_key? })`, `rebind({ principal, binding_id, expected_revision,
  session_durable_id, idempotency_key? })`, and `outboxAck({ binding_id, cursor,
  provider_message_id? })`: the existing relay operations, joined to this transaction.
- `bindingFor({ platform, account_id, chat_id, thread_id })`: the active, unexpired binding
  or NULL. `outboxPending({ binding_id, after_cursor?, limit? })`: the relay page shape, pending
  rows only, ordered by cursor; default 100 and maximum 500.

SQL can access only objects recorded as owned by this extension in the persistent
`extension_objects` registry. Core migration v5 snapshots every existing schema object as
core-owned before extensions run. Each extension's new `<name>_*` objects are recorded under its
owner in the same transaction; a prefix alone never grants access. Names in the registry are
ASCII-case normalized. SQLite's automatic indexes for TEXT/composite primary keys and UNIQUE
constraints inherit their table's owner; a core automatic index remains core-owned.
Ownership survives reopening the store, and a newly appearing lookalike does not become
extension-owned.

SQLite authorizes resolved statements, including `DELETE FROM table` without a WHERE clause.
`sqlite_schema` (`type`, `name`, `tbl_name`, `sql`) is also compared before and after migration
steps and calls. Creating, dropping, renaming or altering an object the extension does not own
rolls back the transaction. Triggers and views are rejected outright, both during statement
authorization and in the schema-effect check, even with a matching prefix.
Transaction-control SQL, PRAGMAs and attached/temporary databases are refused. Table-valued
sources such as `json_each` and `pragma_table_info` are not owned objects and are refused.
This is a store API contract, not a sandbox for untrusted JavaScript modules.

A thrown operation rolls back extension rows and joined core writes together. Inbox
marker writes happen while the transaction's write lock is held, before COMMIT, so a crash
after commit cannot leave committed deliveries without their wake markers. Rollback removes
new inbox markers; a process exit before commit may leave a harmless spurious wake, as in core operations.
A failed marker write rolls back the operation with `extension_notification_failed`.
Marker removals run only after COMMIT. Each removal runs independently: a failure emits an
`extension_error` store event with phase `after_commit` and appears in the successful call's
optional `notification_errors` array. The committed `value` stays successful; do not retry it
as though its transaction had been refused. A returned relay refusal is data, so an operation that wants to undo its
earlier work must throw. Catching an error from `all`, `one` or `exec` does not clear it:
the whole call still rolls back, including for a caught constraint error.

Refusal codes are `extension_import_failed`, `extension_unknown_op`, `extension_unknown_name`,
`extension_schema_violation`, `extension_notification_failed`, `extension_disabled`,
`gateway_lock_wait_exceeded`, and `gateway_schema_too_new`.
Invalid registration input and uncloneable call arguments are `invalid_arguments`; a thrown
operation or expired operation deadline is `extension_operation_failed`. The worker keeps
serving core requests after operation refusals on a supported database. Reserved names, unowned object access, triggers,
views, and forbidden DDL all use `extension_schema_violation`; rejecting a reserved name leaves
that name unregistered. Lock acquisition uses the core busy timeout and
30-second total bound, not an unbounded retry. An operation and its pending helpers have the
same time budget after acquiring the transaction lock. On expiry, the transaction is revoked
and rolled back before the next request runs. This bounds asynchronous waits, not synchronous
JavaScript that blocks the worker's event loop. Using a retained `tx` after the operation
returns throws a typed error (async helpers reject); an unhandled expired-transaction error
is reported as an `extension_error` event with phase `stale_transaction`, without killing
the worker.

An uncaught exception or unhandled rejection raised later by an extension's own timers or
promises does not close the store. The worker attributes it to every extension whose
registered module file appears in the error's stack, emits an `extension_error` event with
phase `async_failure` for each, and disables those extensions for the life of the worker:
later registration and calls return `extension_disabled`, while core operations and other
extensions keep serving. If the failing extension's operation is still running, it is refused
and rolled back. Extensions registered from the same module file are disabled together. An
error whose stack names no registered module file (a non-`Error` value, an error thrown from a
helper module, or a Node callback error without JavaScript frames) cannot be attributed and
still ends the worker, as before. Starting a new store process re-enables the extension.

A core schema newer than this binary supports is refused with `gateway_schema_too_new`
without applying migrations or lowering `user_version`. Extension registration/calls return
the refusal; core methods reject with an error carrying that code. Use a compatible binary
to access that database.

## Connector loop

```bash
id=$(omo thread bind my-session --platform custom --account bot --chat c1 --thread t1 --json | jq -r .binding.binding_id)
omo thread send --binding "$id" --idempotency-key evt-1 --author-id U123 --author-name "Jane Doe" "hello from outside"
# Post each outbox row, then ack exactly the row that was posted, with the platform's message id.
omo thread outbox "$id" --json | jq -c '.rows[]' | while read -r row; do
  cursor=$(jq -r .cursor <<<"$row")
  posted=$(post_to_platform "$row")     # your connector: returns the platform message id
  omo thread ack "$id" "$cursor" --provider-message-id "$posted"
done
token=$(omo thread outbox "$id" --after 0 --json | jq -r '[.rows[] | select(.event == "question" and .question_state == "pending")][0].reply_token')
omo thread answer --binding "$id" --token "$token" --author-id U123 --author-name "Jane Doe" "yes"
```

A question row carries a `reply_token`. `answer --author-id <id> --author-name <display>
[--author-user-id <id>]` names the human who answered (validated like a `send` author); it is recorded
on the question's outbox row as `answered_by` and returned in the answer result, so the outbox keeps
who answered. The answer must arrive through the binding that asked:
another binding is `binding_mismatch` (the question stays pending), and a token minted before a
rebind, expiry or session restart is `stale_token`. While another answer to the same question is
still being handed to the session, a second answer is `answer_in_progress` (exit 1): retry after a
moment, because the first attempt may still fail and leave the question pending. An answer
abandoned mid-hand-off for more than 120 s is taken over by the next one. When the abandoned
attempt finally ends, a failure changes nothing; if the session took its answer after all, the
question is delivered with that answer and the later attempt is `already_answered`, because the
session takes one answer per question. `already_answered` (exit 1) means the answer reached the
session: stop retrying.

A question answered through an omo from before the answer states existed cannot tell a delivered
answer from one whose attempt died halfway, so it counts as an answer in flight since it was
answered: after 120 s the next answer takes it over. If the session already has that answer, it
refuses the new one (`question_already_resolved`): the question is marked delivered with the earlier
answer, and the new one is `already_answered` (exit 1), as is every answer after it. When the
session instead no longer knows the question at all (`unknown_extension_ui_request`,
`unknown_request`), it was closed some other way: answered in the terminal or Desktop, timed out,
or cancelled. The question is then marked delivered with no answer text, and the new answer and
every later one are `already_answered` with "The session no longer waits for this question
(answered or closed elsewhere)". Such a question costs at most one refused frame, and nothing
reaches the session twice.

The answer text takes the form of the request the session reported (`--request-kind`):

| request kind | accepted answer | reaches the session as |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `question` | any non-blank text | a comment (`answers: {}`, `comment: <text>`) |
| `select` | the option label, non-blank | `value: <text>` |
| `confirm` | `yes` or `no` (also `y`/`n`, `true`/`false`; any case, surrounding spaces trimmed) | `confirmed: true` / `false` |
| `input`, `editor` | any text, empty included | `value: <text>` |
| none reported | any non-blank text | `value`, `answers: {}` and `comment` together, plus `confirmed` for a yes/no word |

Without `--request-kind` the answer goes out in every text form at once, so a question, select,
input or editor each reads its own field. A yes/no word (the confirm words above) also goes out as
`confirmed`, which only a confirm reads, so an undeclared confirm answered yes or no resolves that
way; any other text leaves an undeclared confirm resolving as no. An input or editor that should
take an empty answer must name its kind.

Blank means only whitespace or invisible characters (a zero-width space counts as blank). An
answer the request cannot take is `invalid_arguments` (exit 1) and claims nothing. Only a match
marks the question answered and hands the answer to the session's own endpoint. If the session
cannot be reached or no reply comes back, the answer is `host_unavailable` (exit 3). If the session
refuses it (it no longer waits on that question, or cannot read the answer), the answer is
`stale_token`, or `invalid_arguments` for an unreadable answer, with the session's code in
`error.details.reason` (exit 1). The question then becomes (or stays) pending, so it can be answered
again. The one exception is an answer that took over an expired claim (above) and is refused because
the session no longer waits on the request: the question is then delivered with the earlier answer,
and the answer is `already_answered`. A delivered answer is never released.

## Bindings

A binding attaches one session to one external thread, named by `(platform, account, chat,
thread)`; `--thread` defaults to `@chat` (the chat itself). Nothing here talks to a chat platform:
a connector drives the binding.

- At most one `active` binding holds a thread. Binding a thread that is already held is
  `binding_conflict`, with the holder's `binding_id`, `revision` and session in `details`; there is
  no implicit takeover.
- `unbind` and `rebind` name the revision they expect (`--revision`) and are `stale_revision`
  when it moved. Each bumps the revision. An already closed binding unbinds again with
  `already_closed: true`, and `in_flight` lists the deliveries that came through it and are not
  taken yet.
- `rebind` moves the binding to another session: `lease_started_at` resets, `expires_at` does not
  move (a TTL is never extended), and deliveries still queued under the old revision are refused
  `binding_closed` (listed in `closed`), never moved. A detached or expired binding is
  `binding_inactive`.
- `--ttl` is in seconds (default 604800, 7 days); `--ttl none` never expires. `--direction` and
  `--events` (default all four) decide what may flow each way.

## Reports and the outbox

`report` writes a row to a binding's outbox for the connector to post. Only the session a binding
is attached to reports through it (`scope_denied` otherwise), only while the binding is active
(`binding_inactive`) and subscribed to that event (`unsupported`). Without `--binding` the report
goes to the session's ORIGINATING binding, the one its newest admitted external message came
through; a session that took no message through a binding must name `--binding` (`invalid_arguments`).
Nothing is ever copied to the session's other bindings.

- `milestone` and `report` rows are written at once. The first `--provider-message-id` acked for
  a milestone becomes the binding's `progress_message_id`, and later milestone rows carry it as
  `edit_message_id`, so a connector can edit one progress message in place.
- `question` needs `--request-id`, the session's pending request id, and returns the
  `reply_token` the answer must carry. `--request-kind` says which request that id is (`question`,
  `select`, `confirm`, `input` or `editor`); it decides the answer forms above. Without it the answer
  goes out in every text form, and as `confirmed` for a yes/no word (see above).
  Another kind name is `invalid_arguments`, and so is `--request-kind` on a non-question report.
- `completion` is only armed (see below): it answers `armed: true` and `cursor: null`, and its
  row appears when the session settles.

`outbox <binding-id>` reads rows in cursor order. Without `--after` it continues after the
acknowledged cursor; `--after <cursor>` re-reads from an older one. `ack` is idempotent: an older
or equal cursor changes nothing (`changed: false`), and a cursor past the newest row is
`cursor_invalid`. Acked rows are kept 30 days after their ack; unacked rows live as long as their
binding plus 30 days. A detached binding's outbox stays readable.

Delivery between the outbox and the platform is **at-least-once**. A row stays unacked until the
connector acks it, so a connector that dies after the platform accepted a post but before its
`ack` reads the same row again and posts it again. `(binding_id, cursor)` is the row's stable
identity: a connector that must not double-post records it with the platform message (or in its
own store) and skips a row it already posted. The loop is: read, post, then
`ack <binding-id> <cursor> --provider-message-id <id>` for the row just posted.

`outbox --ack` reads a page and acks through its newest row **before anything was posted**. It is
a convenience for scripts that only drain or inspect an outbox; a connector that uses it loses
every row of the page if it crashes before posting them.

### Waking on new rows

`<agent dir>/gateway/outbox.marker` is the outbox wake signal. It is rewritten after every outbox
row insert (a `report`, a `question`, a settled `completion`), in the same write transaction, as a
temp file renamed over the marker, so it is never seen half written. Its content is
`{"binding_id", "cursor", "written_at"}` of the newest insert, across all bindings. It is a wake
hint only: on a change the connector re-reads its own bindings' outboxes with `outbox`, and it
never treats the marker's content as the list of new rows (two inserts may land between two
reads). Watch the `gateway/` directory for events on `outbox.marker`, not the file itself: the
rename replaces the file, which ends a watch on the old one. The marker does not change on
deliveries, acks or any other store write. A connector that cannot watch files polls `outbox`.

The SQLite WAL file (`gateway.sqlite-wal`) is not a supported wake signal. It changes on every
delivery to any session, on checkpoints, and when connections open or close, and it is removed
when the last connection closes, which silently ends a watch on it.

### Completion arms

A completion is opt-in. Only a session with an arm (from `report ... completion`, here or through
its `thread_report` tool) writes one; every other session settles without touching the gateway
store. The arm is durable: the store row is the source of truth, and it is kept until its
completion is written, with the outcome of the run that settled (`completed`, `failed` or
`cancelled`), never at an intermediate turn end.

`report <session> completion` arms the completion (`armed: true`) and wakes the session's
endpoint, so a running session writes it when it next settles, with that run's outcome. The arm is
durable: when no endpoint answers the wake, the session writes it at the first settle after it
next starts. An arm that lands while a run is settling is written at the next run, with that
run's outcome.

A session picks up arms it did not make itself (left by an earlier runtime after a restart or a
crash, or made by `omo thread`) when it starts and on each wake, with a read that takes no write
lock. Settling never waits on the store for long: the session gives the write 250 ms and lets it
finish in the background. A write that cannot get the store's write lock gives up at about 25 s
(never past 30 s) and is retried after the store's 5 s busy timeout, with the same outcome, until
it lands.

## JSON

With `--json`, stdout is exactly one JSON value, also on failure. `list` prints the thread array;
every other subcommand prints the full result.

| Subcommand | `--json` on success |
| --- | --- |
| `list` | `[{thread_id, name, status: live\|resumable, cwd, created_at, updated_at: <ISO 8601 string>\|null, surface: tui\|desktop\|child\|daemon, endpoint: {kind: rpc_host\|tui, socket, routing_id}, alive, error_note?, ...}]`; live and degraded rows use the same bounded final-record policy, so `updated_at` is null rather than an older timestamp when the final complete valid entry's timestamp cannot be proved. After live and degraded rows are combined, the public list sorts known `updated_at` newest first, then unknown activity last, with `thread_id` ascending for ties. A live row also carries its endpoint's own `list_sessions` fields (`sessionId`, the routing handle; `durableSessionId`, `sessionPath`, `attachments`, `kind`, `socket`, `endpoint_kind`) |
| `send` | `{kind:"ok", thread_id, delivery_id, message_seq, delivery: {kind: queued\|queued_offline\|started\|steered, ...}, effective_mode, endpoint_kind: rpc_host\|tui\|null, deduplicated}` |
| `read` | `{kind:"ok", thread_id, items: [{seq, role: user\|assistant\|tool\|system, content}], truncated, next_cursor?, source, source_incomplete?, error_note?}` |
| `bind` | `{kind:"ok", binding: <binding>, deduplicated}` |
| `unbind` | `{kind:"ok", binding, already_closed, in_flight: [delivery ids], deduplicated}` |
| `rebind` | `{kind:"ok", binding, closed: [delivery ids], deduplicated}` |
| `bindings` | `{kind:"ok", bindings: [<binding>], next_cursor}` |
| `report` | `{kind:"ok", binding_id, revision, event, cursor, reply_token, armed, deduplicated}` |
| `answer` | `{kind:"ok", binding_id, cursor, session_durable_id, answered_by: {platform_user_id, display, user_id?} \| null}` |
| `outbox` | `{kind:"ok", binding_id, revision, status, rows: [{cursor, binding_id, revision, event, text, state, created_at, edit_message_id, provider_message_id, reply_token, question_state, outcome, answered_by}], next_cursor, acked_cursor, acked?}`; `answered_by` is the author an answer named (`--author-*` on `answer`), `null` for an answer without one and for every row that is not an answered question |
| `ack` | `{kind:"ok", binding_id, acked_cursor, changed}` |

`<binding>` is `{schema_version, binding_id, revision, status, platform, account_id, chat_id,
thread_id, root_message_id, progress_message_id, session_realm_id, session_durable_id,
direction: {inbound, outbound}, inbound_mode, outbound_events, policy_id, created_at, updated_at,
lease_started_at, ttl_seconds, expires_at}`.

A failure is `{kind:"error", error: {code, message, next_action, details?}}`; the code is one of
the thread error taxonomy (`packages/omo-senpi/src/components/thread/AGENTS.md`, "Error taxonomy").
The failures the CLI answers itself use the same shape: a usage error is `invalid_arguments`
(exit 2), and win32 or a runtime without `node:sqlite` is `unsupported` (exit 4).

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | done |
| 1 | the gateway refused (read `error.code`: `not_found`, `scope_denied`, `binding_mismatch`, `turn_conflict`, `loop_detected`, `answer_in_progress` (retry after a moment), `already_answered` (stop), `invalid_arguments` for a `--mode` above the binding's `inbound_mode` or an author field that is empty, too long or not one line, ...) |
| 2 | usage: unknown subcommand or option, a missing required flag, a non-integer where a number goes, a `--mode` other than `auto`/`steer`/`follow_up` (or `steer`/`--expected-turn` with `--binding`), a `--direction` other than `in`/`out`/`both`, an empty or whitespace-only `send` text, `--author-*` without `--binding` or without both `--author-id` and `--author-name` (the SDK is not loaded) |
| 3 | `host_unavailable`: no endpoint answered where one was needed (never for `send`, which queues offline) |
| 4 | unsupported: win32 (no unix sockets), or a runtime without `node:sqlite` |
| 5 | `internal_error` |

## For scripts in JavaScript

The same operations are importable from the plugin payload, without spawning `omo`:

```js
const { createThreadSdk } = await import(`${pluginRoot}/runtime/thread-sdk/sdk.js`)
const sdk = createThreadSdk({ agentDir, cwd: process.cwd(), uid: process.getuid(), user: "bot" })
try {
  const sent = await sdk.send({ thread: "my-session", text: "ping" })
} finally {
  await sdk.dispose()
}
```

`pluginRoot` is `<omo-ai install>/plugin`. Every method resolves to the same data union as the
CLI's JSON; nothing throws for a refusal. Pass `engineStatusAll` (a function returning the stdout of
`omo host status --all --include-workers --json`) to choose how the engine is run; without it the SDK runs
the engine CLI itself, and when no engine can enumerate it falls back to the endpoint registry on disk.
